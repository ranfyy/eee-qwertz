installation instructions

= Introduction =

I just installed android-x86 on the Win drive D:. 
This creates 2 directories:
  * android-4.0-RC1
  * grub

When I boot Win7 I can easily browse around there and copy files back and forth.


= Details =

In Windows download the 2 files with your web browser of choice and copy them to these directories:
  * D:\android-4.0-RC1\system\usr\keylayout\Generic.kl
  * D:\android-4.0-RC1\system\usr\keychars\Generic.kcm

Reboot and test.
