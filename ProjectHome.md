# keyboard map and layout files for Eee PC 1015PX #

for android-x86 4.0 RC1.

It _might_ work with other Eee PC's keyboards.

Also tested on:
  * Eee701 (Thanks Lukas)
  * EEEPC 1001P (Thanks Ralph)


Here is where these files need to be copied to:
```
/system/usr/idc/AT_Translated_Set_2_keyboard.idc
/system/usr/keychars/qwertz_de_DE.kcm
/system/usr/keylayout/qwertz_de_DE.kl
```
